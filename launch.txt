## How to launch the website:

The Dockerfile for the production container is located at /root/Dockerfile
* note that the web address is hard-coded in 2 places in the file "website/public/js/ngContValidate.js"
The DigitalOcean (http://64.23.255.172:3001/) and lipd.net version are different only in these two lines.
The two containers in use are docker.io/davidedge/lipd_webapps:lipdnet44 (lipd.net) and docker.io/davidedge/lipd_webapps:lipdnet43 (DigitalOcean)

The website is launched from a container at port 3000 in both cases

* The local version of the website does not run correctly (maybe a problem with the node module set)
