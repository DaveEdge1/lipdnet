JSON-LD Tips

// Fake URIs in @context
// units, site, filename, measurement, seasonality, boolean pos/neg, 
// precision, 


	* All key-value pairs
	* Each object is enclosed by curly brackets 
	* Keys of an Object must be unique
	* Expansions means that all IRIs, types and values are replaced so the @context isn't necessary. 
	* Compaction means that we put IRIs, types, and values back into an expanded document to make it more readable.
	* Compaction requires the developer to supply some context for the algorithm to use. 
	* Flattening basically takes your data and puts it into a graph and shows the structure
	*The value associated with the @value key must be either a string, a number, true, false or null.

	*The value associated with the @type key must be a term, a compact IRI, an absolute IRI, a relative IRI, or null.

	*The value associated with the @language key must have the lexical form described in [BCP47], or be null.

	*The value associated with the @index key must be a string.


Arrays


   * Order is not preserved in arrays unless specified with @set or @list
