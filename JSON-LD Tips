JSON-LD Tips



   * All key-value pairs
   * Each object is enclosed by curly brackets 
   * Keys of an Object must be unique
   * Expansions means that all IRIs, types and values are replaced so the @context isn't necessary. 
   * Compaction means that we put IRIs, types, and values back into an expanded document to make it more readable.
   * Compaction requires the developer to supply some context for the algorithm to use. 
   * Flattening basically takes your data and puts it into a graph


Arrays


   * Order is not preserved in arrays unless specified with @set or @list
