- keep working on exception handling: I’ve tried my best, but with each NCDC file I discover a new exception to their own rules...
- settle on a data standard that we’re going to use for PAGES2K, LMR, and GeoChronR
- make this R-friendly (no idea how to, though I know that R can read RDF and csv, so it shouldn’t be too hard). 

Let me know what you see as the next steps!
Cheers
Julien
