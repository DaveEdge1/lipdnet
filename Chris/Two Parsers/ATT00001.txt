dictionary and a matlab structure (filename.mat), the metadata to RDF Turtle
file filename.ttl and the raw data to filename_data.csv . If primary chronological
information is provided in the file, it is exported to filename_chronology.txt

I include an example script of how to use it, which generated the attached figures effortlessly.
